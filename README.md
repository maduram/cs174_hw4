# CS 174 Homework 4 Project
## SJSU Spring 2017 - Pollett

This is the CS 174 Homework 4 Project at SJSU in Spring 2017 submitted by:
**Madula Ramabathiran** and **Aishwarya Borkar**

In this project, it creates a HTML page with the ability to create Web Sheets in spreadsheet format.

This WebSheet can be created by a user with:
* A _new sheet name_ or _code_
	* The new name allows for a new spreadsheet to be created
	* The code is a hash code that users can input to edit, read, or display their spreadsheet.
* Default is two rows and two columns

It works like a regular spreadsheet by adding or removing columns or rows, and basic spreadsheet functions such as arithmetic (addition, multiplication, subtraction) and computing the average between a range of cells.

You can input text in the cells as a regular spreadsheet and save your file.
